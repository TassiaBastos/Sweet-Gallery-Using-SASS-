This project was developed in order to put into practice my knowledge acquired in the study of SASS.
It consists of a static responsive website with basic and fictional candy store information.

## More informations about SASS

In todayâ€™s fast-moving world, understanding what Sass means is an important part of web development. By the way, do you know what Sass is?

If you are new to the development world, you might have heard the term floating around, but you are yet to understand what it is, what it does, and whether or not you should be using it.

In short, we can say that Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features like variables, nesting, partials, mixins, extension/inheritance and operators. The main purpose is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient.

## Running the project

1. Dowload the folder zip
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser (double click or using Live Server extension)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### To build the CSS using SASS

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code, or in another code editor of your choice
2. Delete the CSS folder
3. Certify that you have Node.js installed into your machine
4. You can also install Sass using `npm` by running:
   `npm install -g sass`
5. Write the command below in the terminal:
   `sass --watch sass/styles.sass:css/styles.css`

- And the new file 'styles.css' will be create based to 'styles.sass' file.

6. If you have, use the Live Server extension to open the site to the browser. If not, give a double click on the html file inside the project folder
